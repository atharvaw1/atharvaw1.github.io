Hi, I'm Atharva Wandile, a Masters graduate in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I am a Data Engineer/ Data Scientist with 2 years of experience in building fast and efficient data pipelines.

**Work Background**
==============
I am currently a software developer working at Oak AI with a specialization in data engineering and back-end development. With a robust background in Big Data Pipelines and Databases, I bring expertise in diverse technologies, including Spark, AWS, Apache Storm, RabbitMQ, and both SQL and NoSQL databases. My knack for optimizing low-latency Flask and Golang APIs enhances efficiency in backend web development.

**Research Interests**
==============
My passion lies in reinforcement learning research and its practical applications. I'm currently engaged in a research project with the Lab for Learning and Planning in Robotics at Northeastern University, focusing on Macro-action based learning for multi-agent robotics. My journey in ML and AI began during my undergrad, where I actively pursued projects and internships. Notably, I conducted a research internship at AllGo Embedded Systems, exploring driver activity detection.

**Hobbies**
==============
Beyond coding, you'll find me strumming tunes on my guitar or playing tennis.
