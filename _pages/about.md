Hi, I'm Atharva Wandile, a Masters graduate in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I am a Data Engineer/ Data Scientist with 2 years of experience.

During my time at Redbus, I served as a Software Engineer in the Data Engineering team, specializing in Big Data Pipelines and Customer Life Cycle Management. My expertise spans a range of technologies, including Spark, AWS, Apache Storm, RabbitMQ, and both SQL and NoSQL databases. Additionally, I take pride in optimizing low-latency Flask and Golang APIs for efficient backend web development.

My passion lies in reinforcement learning research and its practical applications. I'm currently engaged in a research project with the Lab for Learning and Planning in Robotics at Northeastern University, focusing on Macro-action based learning for multi-agent robotics. My journey in ML and AI began during my undergrad, where I actively pursued projects and internships. Notably, I conducted a research internship at AllGo Embedded Systems, exploring driver activity detection.
