Education
======
* M.S in Computer Science , Northeastern University, 2023
* Bachelor of Engineering in Information Science, JSS Science and Technology University (SJCE), 2020

Work experience
======
* Software Developer, Oak AI, Boston, MA Jan. 2024 – Present
  *  Strengthened data access controls and amplified system transparency through an orchestrated audit, documentation, and
  clarification of Supabase RLS policies and externally visible entry points.
  *  Engineered an efficient algorithm resulting in the identification of duplicate documents based on text content.

* Research Intern, Lab for Learning and Planning in Robotics(NEU), Boston, MA       May. 2023 – Present
  * Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Developed continuous macro-action environments for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Analyzed and tested continuous macro-action PPO algorithm for robotics and autonomous systems.
  * Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning: Achieved state-of-the-art performance by training agents using option-critic and actor-critic algorithms for centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning on four rooms and petting zoo MPE environments. 
 
* Data Engineer, Redbus           Jan. 2020 - Jul. 2021
  * Big Data Pipelines: Improved customer retention by 10% through the design and implementation of big data pipelines, ETL and parallel processing models for customer life cycle management with cross-functional communication with marketing teams for analysis; leveraging AWS cloud and database technologies (MongoDB, Cassandra, Postgres). 
  * Distributed Parallel Processing in Spark: Slashed processing times by 200% for weekly and monthly statistical analyses implementing Spark programs on AWS platform, enhancing efficiency.
  * Flask and Golang Web APIs: Developed low latency Flask and Golang API’s handling millions of hits per second. Optimized legacy api’s to cut down response time by 50%.

* Machine Learning Intern, Allgo Embedded Systems            Jun. 2019 - Aug. 2019
  *	Performance Prediction: Crafted a sophisticated regression model with 2% error margin tailored to anticipate the academic performance of a specific class. This model utilized historical performance data a from constrained dataset of 1000 students from the preceding batch and was particularly designed for proactive intervention. This precision contributed to data-informed decision-making and enhanced academic outcomes.
